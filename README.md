Welcome to JadeOak OS, an operating system for those that value simplicity, privacy, and security. 
It is a Lubuntu-based Linux operating system, and it comes with a default internet browser option in the deep web browser, also known as the TOR browser. 
The linux-base for JadeOak OS ensures security because any viruses or malware will remain purely local: it will not spread to other users. Also, JadeOak OS is not interconnected, meaning that, even if the root files in one distribution of the operating system becomes compromised, the operating system itself remains safe on a larger level.
It is designed to work on a virtual machine, such as VirtualBox. This ensures maximized security for your information, since the virtual machine has a different IP address than your host computer, making your activity untraceable. 
For Installation Instructions or any issues with the OS, please go to the wiki. There is more detailed information about the OS on the wiki also.
