# JadeOak-OS
After you have installed JadeOak OS on your machine, you will notice that TOR Browser is available for your internet. However, this browser will not work at first. What will happen is that, after downloading and verifying the signature, you will encounter something that says something like “SIGNATURE VERIFICATION FAILED! You might be under attack, or there just might be a networking problem. Click start to try the download again.” It will not look exactly like that, but it will be something like that. Solve it by opening up “Lx Terminal” from “System Tools” and puting “sudo add-apt-repository ppa:micahflee/ppa” into the command prompt. After that is finished, put “gpg --homedir "$HOME/.local/share/torbrowser/gnupg_homedir/" --refresh-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu” into the command prompt. Press enter, or if the operation has already started, just wait. It will take a bit for it to finish the operation. Then, open TOR Browser again and it should work. You will have to do this every time you power off the machine if you want to use TOR Browser. You have to try to start TOR Browser before you do anything else, because TOR Browser must install on your computer before you are able to do anything to it.
