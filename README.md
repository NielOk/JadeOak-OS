Welcome to JadeOak OS, an operating system for those that value simplicity and privacy. 
It has the deep web browser, also known as the Tor browser, added to it as a default internet browser.
It is linux-based and will work on a virtual machine, such as VirtualBox. This ensures maximized security for your information, since the virtual machine appears to be a completely different computer to most websites that collect user data. 
For Installation Instructions or any issues with the OS, please go to the wiki. There is more detailed information about the OS on the wiki also.
